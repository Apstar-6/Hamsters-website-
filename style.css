      <h2> How They Make Great Pets</h2>
      <p> Compared to dogs and cats, hamsters are low maintenance. They require suitable hamster pellets, vegetables, hay and fresh fruit. They don't require excessive training like a dog would just a regular amount of cuddling, handling, and socialising </p> 
      <p> They are small and cute and mostly friendly and easy to pet and cuddle. They are fun to build stuff for and change the layout of their cage and/or playpen. They are inexpensive to spoil with food, toys etc. They doesn't live very long lives, so it makes them good pets for children. </p>
